# React Comment Box
## Overview
The following is a simple comment box made with `AngularJS`, that posts comments to a `laravel` backend.  The comments are saved and displayed in the comment box.

## Contents
The bulk of the non-framework custom work can be found in the following folders:  

`public/js/` - Contains all of the front end code (including the angular code).  
`app/Http/Controllers/` - Contains all the serverside controller logic.  
`resources/views/` - this folder contains the html pages that exist on the site.
